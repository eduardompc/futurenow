1. Django Framework: All the files in the list are part of a Django application and hence share the Django framework as a common dependency.

2. PostgreSQL Database: The models.py file will define the data schema for the PostgreSQL database. The settings.py file will contain the configuration for the database connection.

3. Django Settings: The settings.py file contains the main settings for the Django application. These settings are shared across all other files in the application.

4. URL Configuration: The urls.py files in both the main application directory and the app directory share the responsibility of routing requests based on the URL.

5. WSGI Configuration: The wsgi.py file contains the WSGI configuration for the Django application, which is used by the application server to serve the app.

6. Django Models: The models.py file defines the data models for the application. These models are used in views.py and admin.py files.

7. Django Views: The views.py file contains the views for the application. These views are used in the urls.py file for routing.

8. Django Admin: The admin.py file is used to define the admin interface for the application. It uses the models defined in models.py.

9. Django Apps: The apps.py file is used to configure the Django app. It is used by Django's internal mechanisms.

10. Django Tests: The tests.py file is used to write tests for the app. It uses the models and views defined in models.py and views.py respectively.

11. Psycopg2: This is the PostgreSQL adapter for Python. It is used in settings.py for database connection.

12. __init__.py: These files are used to mark directories as Python package directories. They are present in every directory of the Django application.
