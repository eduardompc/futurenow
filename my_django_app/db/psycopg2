The file "my_django_app/db/psycopg2" is not a valid Python file. It seems like there's a misunderstanding. Psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python and it's not a file that you create, but a library that you install and use in your project.

You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```

And then you can use it in your Django settings.py file to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

Please note that this is not a Python file to be created but a library to be installed and used in your Django project.
